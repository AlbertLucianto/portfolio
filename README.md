<h2 align="center">About</h2>

<p align="center">This project is mainly focus on experimental animations and user interactions,
so I tried to limit the libraries used, which are
<a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, <a href="https://router.vuejs.org/en/">Vue Router</a>, and <a href="http://dynamicsjs.com/">dynamics.js</a>.
In other words, all assets, animations, and interactions you see here are custom made,
including all reusable components you may encounter during the Tour.<br>
<i>Sadly, it's not very responsive and best opened in Chrome, but I hope you enjoy it!</i></p>
